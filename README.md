# Paper-Implementations

This repository contains a collection of code implementations and experiments replicating results from a wide range of influential machine learning and deep learning research papers. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific paper, model, or technique, with code, notes, and sometimes pretrained weights or results.

## Structure

- **Magi/**: Implementations and experiments with Magi model


## Usage

Each folder is self-contained and includes code, scripts, and sometimes notebooks for replicating the results of the corresponding paper. Please refer to the README or notes within each subfolder for specific instructions.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you have suggestions, improvements, or additional replications to add!
